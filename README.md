# What is your BMI status?

# Introduction

This research aims to find out the factors that affect BMI (Body Mass Index) and discuss possible solutions to control BMI within a healthy range. BMI is a numerical value derived from a person's weight and height. It is calculated using the formula:

\[
BMI = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2}
\]

BMI is commonly used to categorize individuals into different weight status groups, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. However, it does not directly measure body fat and may not accurately reflect health status for all individuals.

The dataset in this research is taken from Kaggle. The raw dataset contains 9 columns.
